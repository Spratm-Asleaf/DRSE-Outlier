> Files/codes here are allowed to be edited, distributed, and re-used for any academic/teaching purpose without any warranty. However, you are strongly suggested sharing your codes with publics if you are planning to use codes here. Let's work together to guarantee the reproducibilty of experiments and the verifiability of claims in publications. We believe that this is meaningful to facilitate future research of the signal processing community.

Future research may deny or modify or improve the philosophies, methods, models, and/or claims conveyed in this article. But readers should not try to "find bones from an egg", and codes here are just for your reference, not for your unfriendly criticism. Of course, the authors are open to learn and friendly comments are always welcomed.
